Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in the world. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Though breast cancer is diagnosed in a few men, it occurs predominantly in women. Over decades womenâ€™s health is under risk. A family history of breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, but the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a known family history of the disease. According to the world health organization, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and there were 6,85,000 deaths globally, in the year 2020. Therefore it is very important to analyze the breast cancer data and identify diagnostic markers.

1. Data collection and pre-processing:
The clinical data for this investigation was downloaded from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. One of the most challenging and important cancer genomics initiatives now in progress is TCGA. Details on 1097 patients are contained in the clinical data. There are 3,721 features in the clinical data. Out of all of these features, the ones with all NULL values, the ones with fewer than five values, and the ones with all the same values are eliminated using a python code. 2,672 features make up the filtered data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
1. The patients' ages were examined. Age was acquired, and the number of patients in that age group was plotted. 
2. The drugs that the patients used throughout their therapy course were examined. From the analysis, it can be inferred which drug is most taken by the patients, which combinations are most frequently used, how many different drugs are used by each patient, and many other facts.
3. To determine whether the data set is biassed towards any one race, the race of the patients was examined. 
4. Each patient's progesterone and estrogen receptor status was checked.
5. The area of neoplasm (abnormal growth of tissue) in each breast cancer patients is observed, and the most predominant area of neoplasm sub-division was discovered. 6. Based on the clinical data, it was determined which surgical procedure patients used the most.
7. The histological type of the patient's tumour is reported. 
8. The mostly preferred and used technique of diagnosis among the breast cancer patients in our data is comprehended.
